1. **Data Preparation:**
   - Splits the raw data into features (X) and the target variable (y).

2. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Scales the features using StandardScaler.
   - Imputes missing values using the median strategy.
   - Applies Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) for data augmentation to address class imbalance.

3. **Train-Test Split:**
   - Splits the preprocessed data into training and testing sets.

4. **Model Selection and Hyperparameter Tuning:**
   - Uses a Random Forest Classifier.
   - Performs a grid search for hyperparameter tuning (number of estimators, maximum depth, and minimum samples split) using cross-validation.

5. **Model Evaluation:**
   - Prints the best hyperparameters found during grid search.
   - Evaluates the model using cross-validation accuracy.
   - Fits the model on the training set and evaluates its accuracy on the test set.
   - Prints a classification report with precision, recall, and F1-score for each class.
